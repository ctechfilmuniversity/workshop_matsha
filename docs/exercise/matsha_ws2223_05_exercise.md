# Exercise 5


## Creative Shader Ideas ðŸ¤©

### Task 1 - Coding

Based on the theory and the implemented materials, play around with the code and come up with your own material.

### Task 2 - Concept

Develop a concept for a material and describe it or describe a material that you would be interested in to implement (you don't have to be able to implement it). 

Feel free to use the internet, e.g. shader toy as inspiration
