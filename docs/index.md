# Welcome!

In this workshop, we are looking into aspects of **rendering a 3D scene** in a fragment shader.

## Workshop Topics

* GLSL & the Fragment Shader
* Rendering Algorithms
* Implicit Geometry
* Sphere Tracing
* 3D Scene Setup
* Transformations
* Constructive Solid Geometry
* Blobs
* Further Effects
* Examples
* Creative Exploration
* (Volume Rendering)

This workshop will not cover shading and lighting in detail. For that there is the upcoming *Materials & Shading* workshop.

## Learning Objectives

With this workshop you gain

* a theoretical understanding of rendering a 3D scene within the fragement shader 
* practical experiences with GLSL and fragment shader programming.
