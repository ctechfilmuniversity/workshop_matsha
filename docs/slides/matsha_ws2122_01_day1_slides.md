## The Workshop

Materials & Shading is a complex topic, enough for a term...

---
## Materials & Shading

* Intro Materials and Shading
* Shading vs. Shader
* Local Illumination
* Global Illumination
* NPR Materials
* Advanced Material Properties
* Physically-based Shading
* Material Interfaces
* Real-time Implementations
* ...

???

Why am I saying this? To give a better overview of the topic field and if there is interest we can always do additional days and / projects.

## Workshop Topics

--

* Intro to Shading

--
* Local Illumination

--
* Local Shading Models

--
* Example: Implementation of p5's materials

--
* Toon shading

--
* Creative shading

--
* Scene rendering in a fragment shader

--
* Example: Houdini's Physically Based Material





---

## Learning Objectives

--
* Understand what shading is

--
* Grasp core theoretical concepts of shading and lighting

--
* Be able to implement basic shading concept within a given software

--
* Be able to go from there to explore creative shading options

--
* Be able to implement modern fragment shaders in a creative context

---

## Let's Start

Looks simple enough, right? ðŸ˜Ž

???

* The goal is to re-implement the material available in p5
* And with that I want to demonstrate that commonly used concepts aren't that complicated

---

## Today

* Understand Shading and its properties
* Local Illumination
