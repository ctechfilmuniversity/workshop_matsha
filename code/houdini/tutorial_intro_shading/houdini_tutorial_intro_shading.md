## Tutorial - Introduction To Shading in Houdini

### Task 1

Watch the tutorials and follow along. I recommend to increase the playback speed, for that you need to download the video and watch it e.g. with the [VLC player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). When doing the tutorials, please also turn your brain on.

    * Start Scene: [tutorial_01_intro_principled_shader_start.hipnc](tutorial_01_intro_principled_shader_start.hipnc)

* [Tutorial 03 - Intro Non-Principled Shader]([intro_nonprincipled_shader](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZsz6kZJQ1M2SvwrIFWTdPhEN0Q5JJRvjrV))

*Apologies, I am making some slips in my explanations. E.g. in Tutorial 3, at 2:37, I am saying that I turn off the live render update button, but I meant to say that I am turing it on...*
  

### Task 2

Investigate materials in the Material Palette and read the documentation about the principled shader or any other shader.

### Task 3

Come up with a simple but nice scene including interesting shading effects. Submit a rendering of that scene in your exercise folder.

If you prefer to create the scene and image with a different software, e.g. Unity or Unreal, you can do so. However, then also submit an image of your results of the Houdini tutorials.
