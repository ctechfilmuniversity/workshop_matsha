### BASIC SETUP
- the basic setup is a room with 4 walls and a floor
- each plane has a different material like:
    - slime balls
    - leaves
    - fluffy carpet
    - marshmallow
    - and bubble wrap for the floor
- interaction with the materials: push into it, pull and drag it
- basic sound attached to materials

### ADVANCED SETUP
- many objects with interesting materials
- perfectly matching sounds for interaction
- more advanced interaction: (unexpected) tactile feedback
