# my goals regarding shading

- photorealistic shading: fascinating! but much of time and dedication needed. don't want to go down that rabbit hole... (no 3D artist)

- my fields interests: rather realtime and interactive applications
  
- realtime 3D looks either crappy or requires an extreme low level knowledge and dedication to make it look good
  
- more promising: using custom shaders to manipulate 2D video input (live camera, or video stream) to distort or reshape it artistically 
  
- thought: writing shader code is still difficult to learn, but if it is abstract and not 3D there seem to be a less uncanny valley effect - maybe more interesting and useful results without having to deep dive
