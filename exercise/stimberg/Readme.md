comparing the wooden pepper mill (9) and the ceramic spoon (4)
- the wooden object has barely any highlights while the ceramic one has pretty strong highlights
- the highlights of the ceramic are still visible in indirect light
- the ceramic/shiny/reflective texture makes the texture of the surface good visible, while the wooden one smoothes the material out
