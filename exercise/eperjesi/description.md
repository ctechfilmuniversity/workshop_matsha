this material is a lightsource itself, but a very mild one, and when it it more layer of material, it's not creating light. it is very smooth, not shiny at all, it doesn't have reflections. the transition between the light and the darker areas are also very smooth. it has a yellowish extra color on the top of the original white, and the shadows are also lighter greys than the usual.
