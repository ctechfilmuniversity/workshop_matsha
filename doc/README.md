These files were developed as slides, hence the best way is to get the content is to look at the slides (`_slides.me`). For that you will need to use the [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark) framwork.

The script version of the slides (`_slides.me`) should contain exactly the same content but I made them quickly and might have done some errors.
