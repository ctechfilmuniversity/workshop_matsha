These files were developed as slides, hence the best way is to get the content is to look at the slides (`_slides.me`). For that you will need to use the [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark) framwork with the here provided [style.css](style.css) file.

The script versions of the slides (`_script.me`) should contain exactly the same content but I made them quite quickly and might have done some copy & paste errors. Unfortunately, the equations do not render in the script.md versions.
